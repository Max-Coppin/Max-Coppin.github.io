# 
This repositorie aim is to create my personal web site where you will find most of my work (not much so far) but also some material for outreach project, numerical Cheatsheet (If ever I have the time to finish it). 
\\
It was created using the 
[Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and is highly inspired from the [Charly de Marez's page](https://demarez.github.io/)
\\
Feel free to use and share all the document present on the web site as long as you quote my work
