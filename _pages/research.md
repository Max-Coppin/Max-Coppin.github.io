## Research interest
- Vortex dynamics: 
I am fascinated by the dynamics of vortex structures in the presence of vertical inhomogeneity. 
In particular I am interested in the evolution of vortices under sea ice, convective dipoles, and I would be curious to study the vertical motion and fluxes within an eddy.

- Turbulence in convection :
How does turbulent kinetic energy evolve in a convective plume and in the mixing layer ?
Refinement of turbulence parameterisation and turbulent closure models

- The organisation of convection :
In this part I am interested in the coherent structures that can be observed in convection (plumes, cones, cells, convective vortices) and how these structures are affected by the different convection regimes.
