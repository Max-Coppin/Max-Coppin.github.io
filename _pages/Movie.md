This film show a vortice in an in a 2 +1/2 Rotating Shallow layer code. The vortices are in the midle layer of the model, The bottom layer is at rest and their is no mean flow in the upper layer. This simulation exhibit the influence of an upper-lid firction (right) compard to a frictional free situation. 
    We observe that friction have an effect on the stability by accelarate the splittiing of the vortex. This is an interesting result since we would have expected friction to attenuate the growth rate of the perturbation
    I'm currently studying this process, with in mind the frictional effect that sea ice has on the eddies under the sea ice in the Arctic.
